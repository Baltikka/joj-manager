# joj manager.
a bad file manager.
# features
-no ability to launch anything

-no ability to open anything other than text

-no ability to navigate with mouse or arrow keys

-and more!
# why joj manager?
tired of file managers with fancy UI, mouse support, and can actually be used to manage files?

reconsider your existence.

# there is no point in using joj manager!
